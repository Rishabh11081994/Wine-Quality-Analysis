# Wine-Quality-Analysis
Data is analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. 


# OBJECTIVE
So much about wine making remains elusive—taste is very subjective, making it extremely challenging to predict exactly how consumers will react to a certain bottle of wine. There is no doubt that winemakers, connoisseurs, and scientists have greatly contributed their expertise to the process, but there is still more to be discovered about the art and science of winemaking. Using this data to gain a better understanding of what makes a good quality or bad quality wine according to wine experts' taste-buds and brains. The emphasis is given to exploratory data analysis and various hypothesis testing is accomplished to make out infrences from the data. There are other attributes like price and brand that are not present in the data due to privacy concern. Main empahisis is offered to find out the chemicals which increased the quality of wine. Knowing these variable or
chemical which directly link to quality would definitely help the wine maker to improve the quality of wine.

# Data Details
1 - type of wine: type of wine (categorical: 'red', 'white')

(continuous variables based on physicochemical tests)

2 - fixed acidity: The acids that naturally occur in the grapes used to ferment the wine and carry over into the wine. They mostly consist of tartaric, malic, citric or succinic acid that mostly originate from the grapes used to ferment the wine. They also do not evaporate easily. (g / dm^3)

3 - volatile acidity: Acids that evaporate at low temperatures—mainly acetic acid which can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar-like taste at very high levels. (g / dm^3)

4 - citric acid: Citric acid is used as an acid supplement which boosts the acidity of the wine. It's typically found in small quantities and can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines. (g / dm^3)

5 - residual sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops. It's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter. Wines residual sugar level greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet. On the other end of the spectrum, a wine that does not taste sweet is considered as dry. (g / dm^3)

6 - chlorides: The amount of chloride salts (sodium chloride) present in the wine. (g / dm^3)

7 - free sulfur dioxide: The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine. All else constant, the higher the free sulfur dioxide content, the stronger the preservative effect. (mg / dm^3)

8 - total sulfur dioxide: The amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine. (mg / dm^3)

9 - density: The density of wine juice depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content; it's typically similar but higher than that of water (wine is 'thicker'). (g / cm^3)

10 - pH: A measure of the acidity of wine; most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale. The lower the pH, the more acidic the wine is; the higher the pH, the less acidic the wine. (The pH scale technically is a logarithmic scale that measures the concentration of free hydrogen ions floating around in your wine. Each point of the pH scale is a factor of 10. This means a wine with a pH of 3 is 10 times more acidic than a wine with a pH of 4)

11 - sulphates: Amount of potassium sulphate as a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels; it acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant agent.(g / dm3)

12 - alcohol: How much alcohol is contained in a given volume of wine (ABV). Wine generally contains between 5–15% of alcohols. (% by volume)

Output variable:

13 - quality: score between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent) by wine experts

# Conclusion
In good qulaity wine should contain
large percentage volumne of alcohol and chlorides while the percentage of volatile acidity, residual sugar,
density, fixed acidity	, total sulphur dioxide should be less
